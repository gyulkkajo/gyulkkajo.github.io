This is very first page on github pages. I'm going to keep trying to write down a story here even though it would be hard.

I don't know how to manage this because I already have another blog on http://nophotoplease.tistory.com. Is it good way to divide blogs by language? or contents? Wellâ€¦ We'll see.

By the way, first impression of Jekyll on github pages:

- Variaty of pretty and neat themes.
- Markup language
- Free from hosting server



But:

- Not easy to manage images and assets.
- No online writer.
- Complicated. 



It's been a day and I haven't experienced much, so it maybe too early to judge it but it's true there are many thing to come over hurdles.
